"""
Copy this file to settings.py in same module and update appropriately
for your system. This is mostly for the "ledgershell" commands that use
the ledger client.

The scheduler and sort commands, and most of the reconciler can run
without this file. Some configuration will fall back to defaults in
settings_getter.py.

Re: "most of the reconciler", RECONCILER_CACHE_FILE will be
~/.ledgerbil_reconciler_cache if not in here, so that only the
--reconciled-status feature needs ledger config.

This file needs to be present as settings.py for tests to run. Its
contents are mocked as much as possible, but since not all cases
are handled, we'll rely on this example version for a definitive
test run.
